Single source of truth for all portfolio content.

Everything the templates render comes from here. To add a new work
experience, project, education entry, skill group, publication, or map
location, append a dict to the relevant list below. The Jinja templates loop
over these lists, so no HTML changes are needed to add more items. This is what
satisfies the Flask task: "Add a template for adding multiple work
experiences/education/hobbies using Jinja".
